Redline is grounded in research that shows incident response effectiveness improves when analysts follow structured, 
lifecycle-based methodologies rather than ad-hoc decision making. Industry frameworks such as the NIST Incident Handling Lifecycle and 
guidance from the SANS Institute emphasize early classification, controlled analysis, and phased containment to reduce data loss 
and operational impact. However, real-world incidents often occur under time pressure, where incomplete context and alert fatigue 
degrade human judgment. This gap motivates the use of AI as a decision-support system rather than an autonomous actor.

Recent advances in large language models and retrieval-augmented generation enable AI systems to reason over unstructured 
alerts while remaining grounded in authoritative security playbooks. Redline builds on research in agentic AI by enforcing 
explicit reasoning stages—identification, analysis, and planning—before recommendations are produced. Vector-based semantic 
search allows the system to map novel incidents to historically documented threat patterns, improving consistency and response 
quality. This approach aligns AI assistance with established cybersecurity best practices while preserving human oversight 
and auditability.
